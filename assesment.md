his is the project for skill test.
https://bitbucket.org/devstream39947/game-store/src/main/

The requirements for skill testing are following:
1. When running a project, the landing page moves to Store Browse page. Please fix it.
2. When I first press the top left button, a loading page with an error appears.
This error will not appear the next time I press it.
Please fix it.
3. Develop signup and signin/out function using google login Api and facebook login api.
After that integrate Stripe API into this project for payment.

You should do these requirements and send me the feedback about the project and the result using video.
